Questions:
1. Why JFreeChat and main packages in the code?
2. When integrated into the Intellij IDEA there seems an error in the "javafx" library, why? Is not there any jar included for "javafx"?
3. While running the C++ code using the "green play button on the toolbar" nothing is showing at the output.
